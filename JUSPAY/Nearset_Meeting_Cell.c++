I recently appeared for Juspay OA for SDE-1. There were three questions to be solved, I was only able to solve this one. I am posting the question along with the test case and my solution
Round 1: It was an online round hosted of Juspay on Talscale. It consisted of 3 coding question. The coding question goes like this:

Problem Description :- Nearest Meeting Cell
You are given a maze with N cells. Each cell may have multiple entry points but not more than one exit (i.e. entry/exit points are unidirectional doors like valves). The cells are named with an integer from 0 to N-1.

You are given an array Edge[] of N integers, where Edge[i] contains the cell number that can be reached from of cell i in one step. Edge[i] is -1 if the ith cell doesnâ€™t have an exit.

The task is to find :- Nearest meeting cell : Given any two cells - C1, C2, find the closest cell Cm that can be reached from both C1 and C2.

Note:- The cells are named with an integer value from 0 to N-1. If there is no node pointing to the ith node then weight of the ith node is zero.

INPUT FORMAT :-

The first line contains the number of cells N.
The second line has a list of N values of the edge[ ] array, where edge[i] conatins the cell number that can be reached from cell 'i' in one step. edge[i] is -1 if the ith doesn't have an exit.
Third line for each testcase contains two cell numbers whose nearest meeting cell needs to be found. (return -1 if there is no meeting cell from tw.
OUTPUT FORMAT :
1.Output a single line that denotes the nearest meeting cell (NMC).

Sample Input :
23
4 4 1 4 13 8 8 8 0 8 14 9 15 11 -1 10 15 22 22 22 22 22 21
9 2

Sample Output :
4
